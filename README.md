Hello! I'm Juliana Virginio ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student in Biological Sciences, focusing on bioinformatics and metatranscriptomics. I work with the analysis of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data to understand the microbial dynamics in cattle. 

My areas of interest include:

- Functional gene analysis and annotation using databases such as eggNog, COG, EC, KEGG, MetaCyc Reactions and MetaCyc Pathways, and CAZymes.
- Visualization of biological data using R, with an emphasis on clear and informative graphics.
- Integration of metatranscriptomic and metagenomic data to study differential expression of functions in different ecological and metabolic contexts.
- Automation of bioinformatics pipelines using shell scripts and R to streamline the analysis of large datasets.

Currently, I am exploring how diet influences metatranscriptomic functions and its impact on metabolism, methane emissions, and feed efficiency in _Bos indicus_ cattle.

ðŸ’¡ I'm always curious about new collaborations and opportunities to apply my bioinformatics skills in diverse contexts!
